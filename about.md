might do a Resume type thing here. ~500 hours of projects and assignments through Bloc.

I'm a full stack software engineer, I prefer to work on functionality and building algorithms when it comes to projects, so most of my apps might not have UI. I'm still in school and haven't learned what i really want to learn yet so for now this page will be blank.
