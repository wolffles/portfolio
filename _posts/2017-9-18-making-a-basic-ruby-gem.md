#### In this post I'll be documenting some steps to making a basic ruby gem.

## the initial setup
  1. cd to folder you want no need to generate a directory
  2. in terminal `$ rails new <name of app goes here>`
  3. create a new README file
  4. create the Development Database. bloc.io => module3 checkpoint10
  5. update gemfile
  6. in terminal `$ bundle install --without production`
  7. in terminal `$ rails db:create`
  8. in terminal `$ bundle install`
  9. set up a git repository.
