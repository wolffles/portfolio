## Proficiency Level

1. Javascript: Advanced. (Able to read and write with ease)
2. JQuery: Intermediate. (Understand the language but is not fluent)
3. AngularJS: Intermediate. (Understand the language but is not fluent)

## How I learned

1. Javascript:
 - Learned basics through online coding courses such as Code School.
 - Practiced coding at CodeWars.
 - Started javascript in February 2017 at Bloc: Bootcamp for Developers.
2. JQuery:
 - learned through making Bloc Jams (an itunes-esque web application)

## Projects I've used Javascript with

1. [Bloc Jams](https://wolffles.github.io/bloc-jams/) : an itunes-esque web application
 - languages: javascript, JQuery, and AngularJS
2. [Bloc Jams AngularJS](https://github.com/wolffles/bloc-jams-angular) : an AangularJS version of Bloc Jams
- languages: Javascript and AngularJS
3. [Bloc Chat](https://github.com/wolffles/bloc-chat): messaging web application that uses firebase database to store information.

## Specialities

As of right now I'm just using Javascript as a way to add functionality to webpages, until I complete the Bloc program I wont know the full extent of my abilities, and where my interest lie with this volatile language.

AngularJS is my favorite method to make webpages/ apps, it provides the kind of simplicity that I prefer when it comes to designing.
