## Specialities

None I prefer not to worry about the aesthetics part of a product.

## Finishing thoughts

Even though I don't like to design things myself, I do have an eye for design. It's just at this point in my life I am more worried about spending my time practicing functional code then making something look nice and neglecting functionality.
